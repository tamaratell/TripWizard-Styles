# COMPONENT CODE
This page contains the HTML code for all components for our final project. The html files in this folder are solely meant to be copy-pasted into React as components. For details on how the code is meant to come together, see the html files in the main project directory and follow the main project directory's readme for instructions.

# HOW TO USE IT
The outer directory is structured by parent component. Each parent component file has the full code for that component compiled in the main file, and the code individual children components in files beginning with "__".

## DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

- Main navigation (main: nav.html)
  - Navigation logo (nav__logo.html)
  - Navigation search form (nav/__search.html)
  - Navigation menu (nav/__menu.html)
