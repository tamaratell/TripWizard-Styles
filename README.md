# HOW TO NAVIGATE THIS DOCUMENT
All html files in the main directory (index, favs, login, modal) are fully compiled html documents that show how the page should look like all together. 

To see what the fully compiled document looks like, make sure to install sass (npm install sass), make sure everything is compiled and that sass is watching for changes (sass --watch styles/sass/main.scss:styles/main.css), then press option + b (mac) or alt + b (windows) from the document you wish to view to see the compiled document in your browser. 

## COMPONENTS
The components directory contains all html code to be copy and pasted into React as components. See the components README for more details.
